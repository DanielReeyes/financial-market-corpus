# Financial Market Corpus

This corpus was built from financial market news. All its named entities were extracted from a specific NER tool called SpaCy. The semantic relationships between named entities were manually annotated. Importantly, even though it has been validated with experiments, it does not represent a golden collection, as it has not been corrected by pairs of linguists.
